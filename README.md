# postFusion
Postman collection for working with Lucidworks Fusion search engine (focusing on F4 and F5)

This is a collection of postman requests to provide examples to build on for specific projects.

This setup makes heavy use of environment variables. The goal is to define a set of requests that are "reusable" across several different environments (e.g. dev, test, qa, prod).

There are also a few examples of using Postman's test framework (chai js test framework).

Note: there is also an example of visualization and the template engine:

Check the `Visualization` folder, and the `Datasource Jobs statuses with visualization` sample request which renders an HTML table out of the JSON response of datasource job statuses.
